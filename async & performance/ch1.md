# You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance
# Chapter 1: Asynchrony: Now & Later


## A Program in Chunks

For example, consider this code:

```js
function now() {
	return 21;
}

function later() {
	answer = answer * 2;
	console.log( "Meaning of life:", answer );
}

var answer = now();

setTimeout( later, 1000 ); // Meaning of life: 42
```

There are two chunks to this program: the stuff that will run *now*, and the stuff that will run *later*. It should be fairly obvious what those two chunks are, but let's be super explicit:

Now:
```js
function now() {
	return 21;
}

function later() { .. }

var answer = now();

setTimeout( later, 1000 );
```

Later:
```js
answer = answer * 2;
console.log( "Meaning of life:", answer );
```

The *now* chunk runs right away, as soon as you execute your program. But `setTimeout(..)` also sets up an event (a timeout) to happen *later*, so the contents of the `later()` function will be executed at a later time (1,000 milliseconds from now).

Any time you wrap a portion of code into a `function` and specify that it should be executed in response to some event (timer, mouse click, Ajax response, etc.), you are creating a *later* chunk of your code, and thus introducing asynchrony to your program.

### Async Console

In particular, there are some browsers and some conditions that `console.log(..)` does not actually immediately output what it's given. The main reason this may happen is because I/O is a very slow and blocking part of many programs (not just JS). So, it may perform better (from the page/UI perspective) for a browser to handle `console` I/O asynchronously in the background, without you perhaps even knowing that occurred.

A not terribly common, but possible, scenario where this could be *observable* (not from code itself but from the outside):

```js
var a = {
	index: 1
};

// later
console.log( a ); // ??

// even later
a.index++;
```

We'd normally expect to see the `a` object be snapshotted at the exact moment of the `console.log(..)` statement, printing something like `{ index: 1 }`, such that in the next statement when `a.index++` happens, it's modifying something different than, or just strictly after, the output of `a`.

Most of the time, the preceding code will probably produce an object representation in your developer tools' console that's what you'd expect. But it's possible this same code could run in a situation where the browser felt it needed to defer the console I/O to the background, in which case it's *possible* that by the time the object is represented in the browser console, the `a.index++` has already happened, and it shows `{ index: 2 }`.


## Event Loop

Let's make a (perhaps shocking) claim: despite clearly allowing asynchronous JS code (like the timeout we just looked at), up until recently (ES6), JavaScript itself has actually never had any direct notion of asynchrony built into it.

In other words, the JS engine has had no innate sense of *time*, but has instead been an on-demand execution environment for any arbitrary snippet of JS. It's the surrounding environment that has always *scheduled* "events" (JS code executions).

So, for example, when your JS program makes an Ajax request to fetch some data from a server, you set up the "response" code in a function (commonly called a "callback"), and the JS engine tells the hosting environment, "Hey, I'm going to suspend execution for now, but whenever you finish with that network request, and you have some data, please *call* this function *back*."

The browser is then set up to listen for the response from the network, and when it has something to give you, it schedules the callback function to be executed by inserting it into the *event loop*.


It's important to note that `setTimeout(..)` doesn't put your callback on the event loop queue. What it does is set up a timer; when the timer expires, the environment places your callback into the event loop, such that some future tick will pick it up and execute it.

What if there are already 20 items in the event loop at that moment? Your callback waits. It gets in line behind the others -- there's not normally a path for preempting the queue and skipping ahead in line. This explains why `setTimeout(..)` timers may not fire with perfect temporal accuracy. You're guaranteed (roughly speaking) that your callback won't fire *before* the time interval you specify, but it can happen at or after that time, depending on the state of the event queue.

So, in other words, your program is generally broken up into lots of small chunks, which happen one after the other in the event loop queue. And technically, other events not related directly to your program can be interleaved within the queue as well.

**Note:** We mentioned "up until recently" in relation to ES6 changing the nature of where the event loop queue is managed. It's mostly a formal technicality, but ES6 now specifies how the event loop works, which means technically it's within the purview of the JS engine, rather than just the *hosting environment*. One main reason for this change is the introduction of ES6 Promises, which we'll discuss in Chapter 3, because they require the ability to have direct, fine-grained control over scheduling operations on the event loop queue (see the discussion of `setTimeout(..0)` in the "Cooperation" section).

## Parallel Threading

It's very common to conflate the terms "async" and "parallel," but they are actually quite different. Remember, async is about the gap between *now* and *later*. But parallel is about things being able to occur simultaneously.

The most common tools for parallel computing are processes and threads. Processes and threads execute independently and may execute simultaneously: on separate processors, or even separate computers, but multiple threads can share the memory of a single process.

An event loop, by contrast, breaks its work into tasks and executes them in serial, disallowing parallel access and changes to shared memory. Parallelism and "serialism" can coexist in the form of cooperating event loops in separate threads.

===============================

In a single-threaded environment, it really doesn't matter that the items in the thread queue are low-level operations, because nothing can interrupt the thread. But if you have a parallel system, where two different threads are operating in the same program, you could very likely have unpredictable behavior.

Consider:

```js
var a = 20;

function foo() {
	a = a + 1;
}

function bar() {
	a = a * 2;
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", foo );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", bar );
```

In JavaScript's single-threaded behavior, if `foo()` runs before `bar()`, the result is that `a` has `42`, but if `bar()` runs before `foo()` the result in `a` will be `41`.

JavaScript never shares data across threads, which means *that* level of nondeterminism isn't a concern. But that doesn't mean JS is always deterministic. Remember earlier, where the relative ordering of `foo()` and `bar()` produces two different results (`41` or `42`)?

**Note:** It may not be obvious yet, but not all nondeterminism is bad. Sometimes it's irrelevant, and sometimes it's intentional. We'll see more examples of that throughout this and the next few chapters.

### Run-to-Completion

Because of JavaScript's single-threading, the code inside of `foo()` (and `bar()`) is atomic, which means that once `foo()` starts running, the entirety of its code will finish before any of the code in `bar()` can run, or vice versa. This is called "run-to-completion" behavior.

In fact, the run-to-completion semantics are more obvious when `foo()` and `bar()` have more code in them, such as:

```js
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

function foo() {
	a++;
	b = b * a;
	a = b + 3;
}

function bar() {
	b--;
	a = 8 + b;
	b = a * 2;
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", foo );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", bar );
```

Because `foo()` can't be interrupted by `bar()`, and `bar()` can't be interrupted by `foo()`, this program only has two possible outcomes depending on which starts running first -- if threading were present, and the individual statements in `foo()` and `bar()` could be interleaved, the number of possible outcomes would be greatly increased!

===============================

Two outcomes from the same code means we still have nondeterminism! But it's at the function (event) ordering level, rather than at the statement ordering level (or, in fact, the expression operation ordering level) as it is with threads. In other words, it's *more deterministic* than threads would have been.

As applied to JavaScript's behavior, this function-ordering nondeterminism is the common term "race condition," as `foo()` and `bar()` are racing against each other to see which runs first. Specifically, it's a "race condition" because you cannot predict reliably how `a` and `b` will turn out.

**Note:** If there was a function in JS that somehow did not have run-to-completion behavior, we could have many more possible outcomes, right? It turns out ES6 introduces just such a thing (see Chapter 4 "Generators"), but don't worry right now, we'll come back to that!

## Concurrency

### Interaction

More commonly, concurrent "processes" will by necessity interact, indirectly through scope and/or the DOM. When such interaction will occur, you need to coordinate these interactions to prevent "race conditions," as described earlier.

Here's a simple example of two concurrent "processes" that interact because of implied ordering, which is only *sometimes broken*:

```js
var res = [];

function response(data) {
	res.push( data );
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```

The concurrent "processes" are the two `response()` calls that will be made to handle the Ajax responses. They can happen in either-first order.

Let's assume the expected behavior is that `res[0]` has the results of the `"http://some.url.1"` call, and `res[1]` has the results of the `"http://some.url.2"` call. Sometimes that will be the case, but sometimes they'll be flipped, depending on which call finishes first. There's a pretty good likelihood that this nondeterminism is a "race condition" bug.

**Note:** Be extremely wary of assumptions you might tend to make in these situations. For example, it's not uncommon for a developer to observe that `"http://some.url.2"` is "always" much slower to respond than `"http://some.url.1"`, perhaps by virtue of what tasks they're doing (e.g., one performing a database task and the other just fetching a static file), so the observed ordering seems to always be as expected. Even if both requests go to the same server, and *it* intentionally responds in a certain order, there's no *real* guarantee of what order the responses will arrive back in the browser.

So, to address such a race condition, you can coordinate ordering interaction:

```js
var res = [];

function response(data) {
	if (data.url == "http://some.url.1") {
		res[0] = data;
	}
	else if (data.url == "http://some.url.2") {
		res[1] = data;
	}
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```

Regardless of which Ajax response comes back first, we inspect the `data.url` (assuming one is returned from the server, of course!) to figure out which position the response data should occupy in the `res` array. `res[0]` will always hold the `"http://some.url.1"` results and `res[1]` will always hold the `"http://some.url.2"` results. Through simple coordination, we eliminated the "race condition" nondeterminism.

The same reasoning from this scenario would apply if multiple concurrent function calls were interacting with each other through the shared DOM, like one updating the contents of a `<div>` and the other updating the style or attributes of the `<div>` (e.g., to make the DOM element visible once it has content). You probably wouldn't want to show the DOM element before it had content, so the coordination must ensure proper ordering interaction.


### Cooperation

Another expression of concurrency coordination is called "cooperative concurrency." Here, the focus isn't so much on interacting via value sharing in scopes (though that's obviously still allowed!). The goal is to take a long-running "process" and break it up into steps or batches so that other concurrent "processes" have a chance to interleave their operations into the event loop queue.

For example, consider an Ajax response handler that needs to run through a long list of results to transform the values. We'll use `Array#map(..)` to keep the code shorter:

```js
var res = [];

// `response(..)` receives array of results from the Ajax call
function response(data) {
	// add onto existing `res` array
	res = res.concat(
		// make a new transformed array with all `data` values doubled
		data.map( function(val){
			return val * 2;
		} )
	);
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```

If `"http://some.url.1"` gets its results back first, the entire list will be mapped into `res` all at once. If it's a few thousand or less records, this is not generally a big deal. But if it's say 10 million records, that can take a while to run (several seconds on a powerful laptop, much longer on a mobile device, etc.).

While such a "process" is running, nothing else in the page can happen, including no other `response(..)` calls, no UI updates, not even user events like scrolling, typing, button clicking, and the like. That's pretty painful.

So, to make a more cooperatively concurrent system, one that's friendlier and doesn't hog the event loop queue, you can process these results in asynchronous batches, after each one "yielding" back to the event loop to let other waiting events happen.

Here's a very simple approach:

```js
var res = [];

// `response(..)` receives array of results from the Ajax call
function response(data) {
	// let's just do 1000 at a time
	var chunk = data.splice( 0, 1000 );

	// add onto existing `res` array
	res = res.concat(
		// make a new transformed array with all `chunk` values doubled
		chunk.map( function(val){
			return val * 2;
		} )
	);

	// anything left to process?
	if (data.length > 0) {
		// async schedule next batch
		setTimeout( function(){
			response( data );
		}, 0 );
	}
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", response );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", response );
```

We process the data set in maximum-sized chunks of 1,000 items. By doing so, we ensure a short-running "process," even if that means many more subsequent "processes," as the interleaving onto the event loop queue will give us a much more responsive (performant) site/app.

Of course, we're not interaction-coordinating the ordering of any of these "processes," so the order of results in `res` won't be predictable. If ordering was required, you'd need to use interaction techniques like those we discussed earlier, or ones we will cover in later chapters of this book.

We use the `setTimeout(..0)` (hack) for async scheduling, which basically just means "stick this function at the end of the current event loop queue."

**Note:** `setTimeout(..0)` is not technically inserting an item directly onto the event loop queue. The timer will insert the event at its next opportunity. For example, two subsequent `setTimeout(..0)` calls would not be strictly guaranteed to be processed in call order, so it *is* possible to see various conditions like timer drift where the ordering of such events isn't predictable. In Node.js, a similar approach is `process.nextTick(..)`. Despite how convenient (and usually more performant) it would be, there's not a single direct way (at least yet) across all environments to ensure async event ordering. We cover this topic in more detail in the next section.

## Jobs

As of ES6, there's a new concept layered on top of the event loop queue, called the "Job queue." The most likely exposure you'll have to it is with the asynchronous behavior of Promises (see Chapter 3).

Unfortunately, at the moment it's a mechanism without an exposed API, and thus demonstrating it is a bit more convoluted. So we're going to have to just describe it conceptually, such that when we discuss async behavior with Promises in Chapter 3, you'll understand how those actions are being scheduled and processed.

So, the best way to think about this that I've found is that the "Job queue" is a queue hanging off the end of every tick in the event loop queue. Certain async-implied actions that may occur during a tick of the event loop will not cause a whole new event to be added to the event loop queue, but will instead add an item (aka Job) to the end of the current tick's Job queue.

It's kinda like saying, "oh, here's this other thing I need to do *later*, but make sure it happens right away before anything else can happen."

Or, to use a metaphor: the event loop queue is like an amusement park ride, where once you finish the ride, you have to go to the back of the line to ride again. But the Job queue is like finishing the ride, but then cutting in line and getting right back on.

A Job can also cause more Jobs to be added to the end of the same queue. So, it's theoretically possible that a Job "loop" (a Job that keeps adding another Job, etc.) could spin indefinitely, thus starving the program of the ability to move on to the next event loop tick. This would conceptually be almost the same as just expressing a long-running or infinite loop (like `while (true) ..`) in your code.

Jobs are kind of like the spirit of the `setTimeout(..0)` hack, but implemented in such a way as to have a much more well-defined and guaranteed ordering: **later, but as soon as possible**.

Let's imagine an API for scheduling Jobs (directly, without hacks), and call it `schedule(..)`. Consider:

```js
console.log( "A" );

setTimeout( function(){
	console.log( "B" );
}, 0 );

// theoretical "Job API"
schedule( function(){
	console.log( "C" );

	schedule( function(){
		console.log( "D" );
	} );
} );
```

You might expect this to print out `A B C D`, but instead it would print out `A C D B`, because the Jobs happen at the end of the current event loop tick, and the timer fires to schedule for the *next* event loop tick (if available!).

In Chapter 3, we'll see that the asynchronous behavior of Promises is based on Jobs, so it's important to keep clear how that relates to event loop behavior.



## Review

A JavaScript program is (practically) always broken up into two or more chunks, where the first chunk runs *now* and the next chunk runs *later*, in response to an event. Even though the program is executed chunk-by-chunk, all of them share the same access to the program scope and state, so each modification to state is made on top of the previous state.

Whenever there are events to run, the *event loop* runs until the queue is empty. Each iteration of the event loop is a "tick." User interaction, IO, and timers enqueue events on the event queue.

At any given moment, only one event can be processed from the queue at a time. While an event is executing, it can directly or indirectly cause one or more subsequent events.

Concurrency is when two or more chains of events interleave over time, such that from a high-level perspective, they appear to be running *simultaneously* (even though at any given moment only one event is being processed).

It's often necessary to do some form of interaction coordination between these concurrent "processes" (as distinct from operating system processes), for instance to ensure ordering or to prevent "race conditions." These "processes" can also *cooperate* by breaking themselves into smaller chunks and to allow other "process" interleaving.
