# You Don't Know JS: *this* & Object Prototypes
# Chapter 1: `this` Or That?


## Why `this`?

Let's try to illustrate the motivation and utility of `this`:

```js
function identify() {
	return this.name.toUpperCase();
}

function speak() {
	var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify.call( this );
	console.log( greeting );
}

var me = {
	name: "Kyle"
};

var you = {
	name: "Reader"
};

identify.call( me ); // KYLE
identify.call( you ); // READER

speak.call( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE
speak.call( you ); // Hello, I'm READER
```

If the *how* of this snippet confuses you, don't worry! We'll get to that shortly. Just set those questions aside briefly so we can look into the *why* more clearly.

This code snippet allows the `identify()` and `speak()` functions to be re-used against multiple *context* (`me` and `you`) objects, rather than needing a separate version of the function for each object.

Instead of relying on `this`, you could have explicitly passed in a context object to both `identify()` and `speak()`.

```js
function identify(context) {
	return context.name.toUpperCase();
}

function speak(context) {
	var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify( context );
	console.log( greeting );
}

identify( you ); // READER
speak( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE
```


The more complex your usage pattern is, the more clearly you'll see that passing context around as an explicit parameter is often messier than passing around a `this` context.


### Confusions: Itself

The first common temptation is to assume `this` refers to the function itself. That's a reasonable grammatical inference, at least.

Why would you want to refer to a function from inside itself? The most common reasons would be things like recursion (calling a function from inside itself) or having an event handler that can unbind itself when it's first called.

Developers new to JS's mechanisms often think that referencing the function as an object (all functions in JavaScript are objects!) lets you store *state* (values in properties) between function calls. While this is certainly possible and has some limited uses, the rest of the book will expound on many other patterns for *better* places to store state besides the function object.

=========================

**Note:** The old-school but now deprecated and frowned-upon `arguments.callee` reference inside a function *also* points to the function object of the currently executing function. This reference is typically the only way to access an anonymous function's object from inside itself. The best approach, however, is to avoid the use of anonymous functions altogether, at least for those which require a self-reference, and instead use a named function (expression). `arguments.callee` is deprecated and should not be used.



### Confusions: Its Scope

The next most common misconception about the meaning of `this` is that it somehow refers to the function's scope. It's a tricky question, because in one sense there is some truth, but in the other sense, it's quite misguided.

To be clear, `this` does not, in any way, refer to a function's **lexical scope**. It is true that internally, scope is kind of like an object with properties for each of the available identifiers. But the scope "object" is not accessible to JavaScript code. It's an inner part of the *Engine*'s implementation.



## What's `this`?

Having set aside various incorrect assumptions, let us now turn our attention to how the `this` mechanism really works.

We said earlier that `this` is **not an author-time binding but a runtime binding**. It is contextual based on the conditions of the function's invocation. `this` binding has nothing to do with where a function is declared, but has instead everything to do with the manner in which the function is called.

When a function is invoked, an activation record, otherwise known as an execution context, is created. This record contains information about where the function was called from (the call-stack), *how* the function was invoked, what parameters were passed, etc. One of the properties of this record is the `this` reference which will be used for the duration of that function's execution.

In the next chapter, we will learn to find a function's **call-site** to determine how its execution will bind `this`.

## Review (TL;DR)

`this` is neither a reference to the function itself, nor is it a reference to the function's *lexical* scope.

`this` is actually a binding that is made when a function is invoked, and *what* it references is determined entirely by the call-site where the function is called.
